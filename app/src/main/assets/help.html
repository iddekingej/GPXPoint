        GPS Location is a simple app that displays the following information:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Position (latitude/longitude)</li>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Altitude</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Number of satellites</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        The GPS information is displayed after turning on  "Display GPS position". Disabling it will save
        battery life.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes the following message is displayed temporarily:"Warning: GPS is temporarily unavailable".
        This is normal behavior.

        On the right there is the following icon:<br/>
        <img src="copyicon.png"><br>
        By clicking oh this icon information is copied to the clipboard.
