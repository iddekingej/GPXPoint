        GPS Location is a simple app that displays the following information<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Position (latitude/longitude)</li>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Altitude</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Number of satellites</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        The GPS information is displayed after turning on  "Display GPS position". Disabling it will save
        battery life.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes temporarily  the following message is displayed:"Warning: GPS is temporarily unavailable".
        This is normal behaviour
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On the right of the screen near the "Position" and "Other" section title, there is a small icon.
        Clicking oh this icon will copy the information to the clipboard.
